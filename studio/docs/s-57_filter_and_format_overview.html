	<title>S-57 Filter and Format Overview</title>
	
</head>
	<body>
		<p>S-57 is an IHO transfer standard for digital hydrographic data used in oceanographic applications. It is a hierarchical collection of spatial and feature objects with detailed attribute and relationship data. S-57 consists of different application profiles. The current version of S-57 (version 3.1) provides the ENC (Electronic Navigational Chart) profile. Additional application profiles have been defined by the UKHO as part of their AML (Additional Military Layers) products. AML (version 1.0) provides the following profiles: CLB (Contour Line Bathymetry), ESB (Environment, Seabed and Beach), LBO (Large Bottom Objects), MFF (Maritime Foundation and Facilities), RAL (Routes, Areas and Limits) and SBO (Small Bottom Objects). All of these profiles use binary S-57 format.</p>
		<p>The S-57 Filter allows MapLink Pro Studio to read binary S-57 data that conforms to the ENC and AML profiles. The current version of the filter supports ENC version 3.1 and AML version 1.0.</p>
		<p>An S-57 dataset consists of a base file having the file extension ".000" together with possible update files having file extensions from ".001" to ".999". Update files must be in the same directory as the base file. Update files will be automatically loaded when the base file is loaded.</p>
		<p>An S-57 exchange set is a collection of S-57 datasets and support files. The contents of an exchange set is given by the catalogue file, CATALOG.031, that is included as part of the exchange set. If the S-57 filter is given a catalogue file to load then it loads all dataset files that are listed in the catalogue file. If a dataset consists of a base file and update files then the filter will automatically load the files specified by the catalogue. Note that the catalogue must list both the base and update files (the filesystem paths to such files are relative to the exchange set directory) and the filter does not automatically try to determine the update files, as for the dataset case.</p>
		<h2>Available Datasets</h2>
			<p>There are two ‘Dataset’ configurations for S-57. </p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>S-57 ENC 3.1</li>
				<li>S-57 ENC 3.1 (S-52)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The traditional dataset used by MapLink Pro Studio users is the first item [S-57 ENC 3.1]. This requires the user to setup the feature rendering manually for each scale product or to reuse previous feature books that the user has created.</p>
			<p><a href="s-52_overview.html">The second dataset [S-57 ENC 3.1 (S-52)] automates the feature rendering and addresses the dynamic nature of S-52 visulisation.</a> This dataset configuration changes the way the S-57 data is processed so that the resultant map can be visulised using the S-52 Dynamic Renderer. This additionally removes the need for the user of MapLink Pro Studio to setup the Feature Rendering. Additional information about S-52 can be found <a href="s-52_overview.html">here.</a></p>
			<p><b>.000 File description</b></p>
			<p>The S-57 file contains the data’s geometrical information. MapLink Pro Studio supports the following geometrical primitives used in the S-57 format:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Point</b></li>
				<li><b>Soundings</b> (a special case of a point with multiple locations, with the third coordinate being a depth)</li>
				<li><b>Line</b></li>
				<li><b>Area</b> (polygon)</li>
				<li>3-point Arc</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The S-57 Filter can be configured on file-by-file basis, or dataset-by-dataset basis. In both cases the <a href="s-57_configuration_panel.html">S-57 Configuration Panel</a> is used.</p>
			<p>Encrypted S-57 is supported using the S-63 SDK. Due to the requirements of the IHO accreditation tests and workflow, this is runtime only. Please refer to the Developer’s Guide and S63 ingest sample.</p>
