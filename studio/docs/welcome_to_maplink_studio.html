	<title>Welcome to MapLink Pro Studio</title>
	
</head>
	<body>
		<p>MapLink Pro Studio helps you to build powerful, fast and effective maps for use in run-time applications. The wide range of facilities provided by MapLink Pro Studio means that maps of any degree of complexity can be produced.</p>
		<p>Here is how MapLink Pro Studio makes life simple for both the map producer and the map user:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Generation of multi-layer maps is made easy. Each layer of the map can be configured to present the correct level of information to the user, and to ensure that the display times in the run-time environment are kept as small as possible. Layering, tiling, filtering, clipping and masking are the basic facilities which you will use.</li>
			<li>A huge range of rendering options means that almost any effect can be provided in the map. The unique MapLink Feature Book means that it is easy to build on rendering work that you have already done in previous projects.</li>
			<li>A wide range of input data sources is supported, so that you can probably work straight away with data from your existing map vendor. Extensive sets of projections and datums are supported, so that it is easy to combine data originating from disparate coordinate systems.</li>
			<li>Many specialised facilities give you a unique degree of fine control over your maps. Keyholing, optimisation, multi-part rendering and multiple palettes are just a few of the possibilities.</li>
			<li>The output map produced by MapLink Pro Studio is completely self-contained, and includes all the information that is needed for effective management of the map in run-time applications. The comprehensive API that is supplied with MapLink means that you can be creating applications that provide sophisticated map navigation facilities within minutes of starting work.</li>
		</ul>
