# MapLink Pro Version Lifecyle Information

Envitia supports the two latest major versions of MapLink Pro, giving customers plenty of time to upgrade to the latest major version.

We do not offer upgrades or patches to end-of-life versions of MapLink Pro.

If you still require support for end-of-life versions, this will incur a premium and will be based on best-endeavours using in-support versions of the product.

> **MapLink Pro 11: The next major release of MapLink Pro is coming soon. When this happens, MapLink Pro 8.x will enter support and maintenance end-of-life. If this affects your contracts, [please contact us to discuss how to bring your systems up-to-date](mailto:info@envitia.com).**

# SDK & Feature Deprecation

A deprecated SDK or feature will continue to be available in the product until the next major version.

Where possible, a deprecation will be accompanied with a recommendation for an alternative solution.
